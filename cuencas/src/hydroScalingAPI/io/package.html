    This package contains all the classes that comunicate directly with the
database.  The different classes have the capability to read and write the
CUENCAS database formats.  These classes can deliver the data in appropriate
formats to be used by VisAD or other visualization and analysis packages.  No
classes outside this package should access the database.  All other classes
access the database indirecly, which means that future modifications of data
formats and standards should not impact the rest of the hydroScalingAPI.
